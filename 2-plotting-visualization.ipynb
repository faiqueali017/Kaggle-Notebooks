A larger number of bins will result in smaller, more detailed intervals, whereas a smaller number of bins will result in larger, broader intervals.\n\n**Visualization:** The choice of the number of bins can significantly affect the appearance of the histogram. Too few bins may oversimplify the data distribution, while too many bins may make the plot noisy and harder to interpret.\n\n**Balancing Act:** Selecting the right number of bins is often a balance between capturing the underlying data distribution and making the plot visually informative.
